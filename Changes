Revision history for Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable-Module-GitHub

0.01    2011-05-03
        First version.  These are modules I've been using in #dancer on
        irc.perl.org, and I figured it would be helpful to package them up and
        release them to CPAN.

        I have further plans to implement, including a module to handle GitHub
        hooks by spawning a super-basic web server on a configured port which
        would receive JSON payloads from GitHub's hooks and do the appropriate
        thing (announcing commits/changed issues/pull requests/etc)
